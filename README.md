# smartparking-system

In this i have developed demo of the smart parking system.
The parking places can be modified in the veichle class by changing the arr size in the same class

Parkingslots.class will work as the server
Inservice.class, Outservice.class and Ownerservice.class will work as clients to the server which will be used to modify the parking slots.

veichle.class consists of the structure of the veichle parked as well the amount collected till now.
This system as well tells the customer how much time that he/she has to wait in order to get parking slot if the parking space is full.
